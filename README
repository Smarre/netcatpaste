=== netcatpaste ===

This is simple utility to paste blobs of text over netcat. This version is currently tailored for BSD type
of netcat, which requires TCP half-close in order to terminate the connection.

netcat6 can be used with --half-close argument, for example

    cat | paste.service.fi 1234 --half-close
    inputtext
    ^D

GNU netcat (http://netcat.sourceforge.net/), as far as I know, does not support TCP half-close, so supporting that
netcat would require timeout-based connection shutting, which was the original way I implemented this.
Since one daemon can’t support both, I guess having one version running on other port and one on other would be possible,
though that will make it more complex for users.

There is no particular daemon support for the project at the moment, just running the program would suffice. At the moment
paste saving directory is hardcoded to ./paste, that is, the netcatpaste will create a directory called “paste” in the directory
the client was ran from.

Pastes can be made accessable for example by putting Nginx to point to the paste directory, serving the files from there.

Contributions are welcome :) The project is maintained through my Gerrit instance, at http://gerrit.smar.fi/#/q/project:netcatpaste,
but I will process Github pull requests too, by pushing the to the repo myself. Github repository is official clone of the project.
